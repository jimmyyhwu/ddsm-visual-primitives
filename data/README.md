# DDSM Data

Please run [`download-data.sh`](download-data.sh) to download and extract the DDSM data. The data should include `ddsm_patches`, `ddsm_labels`, `ddsm_raw`, and `ddsm_masks`.

*Optional:* See the [`preprocessing`](preprocessing) directory for code we used to preprocess the DDSM images to generate image patches. Note that the preprocessing code may require installing additional dependencies to run.
